 * Baseline security headers applied to every response.
 *
 * CSP ships as `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` so the browser
 * surfaces violations in the console without blocking anything — once
 * we have confidence nothing legit trips it (two deploys, a pass on
 * every route), flip the key to `Content-Security-Policy` to enforce.
 *
 * The rest of the headers are straight blocks, safe to enforce today:
 *   - HSTS: only meaningful on HTTPS (no-op on http://localhost).
 *   - X-Content-Type-Options / X-Frame-Options / Referrer-Policy:
 *     baseline OWASP hardening, no behavioural cost.
 *   - Permissions-Policy: we don't use camera / microphone / etc, so
 *     deny them. A supply-chain compromise or a forgotten plugin
 *     can't silently opt back in.

   * Cache-Control policy.
   *
   * Why this exists:
   *   Hostinger's CDN was applying `s-maxage=31536000` (1 year) to
   *   prerendered HTML pages by default. When a new deploy shipped
   *   fresh Turbopack chunk hashes, the edge kept serving year-old
   *   HTML referencing chunk filenames that no longer existed on
   *   disk — result: HTML 200, every /_next/static/*.js and .css
   *   came back 404, the page rendered unstyled. Private/incognito
   *   did nothing because the cache is server-side.
   *
   * Strategy:
   *   - /_next/static/* — leave to Next. Turbopack dev chunks can go
   *     stale if we force immutable caching here; Next already emits
   *     the correct production headers for hashed assets.
   *   - /api/*          — no-store. API responses are per-user and
   *     must never be shared across requests at the edge.
   *   - Authenticated dashboard routes (/dashboard, /inbox, /contacts,
   *     /pipelines, /broadcasts, /automations, /settings, /reports —
   *     same list middleware.ts treats as protected) — no-store.
   *     These used to fall into the "everything else" public bucket
   *     below on the assumption that Next.js + Supabase auth would
   *     keep per-user responses out of a shared cache — they don't:
   *     this header rule is applied by Next.js itself to every
   *     matching response, INCLUDING the RSC differential-fetch
   *     requests the client router makes for in-app navigations (e.g.
   *     clicking a different conversation in /inbox does a
   *     `router.replace` that still hits this same rule). A `public,
   *     s-maxage=300` there lets Render's edge (or any intermediary)
   *     cache one conversation's RSC payload and serve it back for a
   *     different one, which the client router can't reconcile — it
   *     falls back to a full hard navigation to recover. Symptom: the
   *     whole page visibly reloads (URL flash, favicon spinner)
   *     instead of just swapping the thread. `no-store` sidesteps all
   *     of that; these routes are per-user and dynamic anyway, so
   *     there's no caching benefit being given up.
   *   - Everything else — public, brief s-maxage + generous
   *     stale-while-revalidate. The edge serves instantly from cache
   *     for the first 5 min, then returns cached content while
   *     refreshing in the background for up to 24 h. A deploy's
   *     chunk-hash drift self-heals within ~5 min with no user-
   *     visible latency.
   *
   * Security headers are appended via a separate catch-all rule
   * below — Next.js merges headers from every matching rule, so
   * they apply to every response regardless of which cache rule
   * matched.
